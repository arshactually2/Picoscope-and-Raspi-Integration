PicoScope Oscilloscope 2000 Series Integration with Raspberry Pi 3 Documentation
Introduction
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for integrating the PicoScope Oscilloscope 2000 series, Model 2204a, with a Raspberry Pi 3. The integration enables you to obtain readings from the oscilloscope using Python scripts.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the integration, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspi OS (32-bit version) installed.
SSH authentication enabled on the Raspberry Pi during configuration.
Step 1: Raspberry Pi 3 Configuration
1.1 Install Raspi OS and Enable SSH
Install the Raspi OS (32-bit version) on the Raspberry Pi. Ensure that SSH authentication is turned on during the configuration.

1.2 Check Internet Connectivity
Verify the internet connectivity on the Raspberry Pi using the following command:


    
ping www.google.com
To exit, use Ctrl + C.

Step 2: Local Computer Setup
2.1 Connect to Raspberry Pi via Remote-SSH
Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), install the Remote-SSH extension. Connect to the Raspberry Pi using the following command:

 
    
ssh username@inetaddress_of_pi
Enter the password set during installation.

2.2 Update Raspberry Pi
Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is up to date by running the following commands:

  
    
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
2.3 Install Git
Install Git on the Raspberry Pi:

  
    
sudo apt install git pip
2.4 Install PicoLog 6.2.8
Download and install PicoLog 6.2.8 for the required libraries:

  
    
wget https://www.picotech.com/download/software/picolog6/sr/picolog-6.2.8-armhf.deb
dpkg-deb -R picolog-6.2.8-armhf.deb picolog-6.2.8-armhf
Create a new directory named resources and copy all libraries from $HOME/picolog-6.2.8-armhf/opt/PicoLog/resources to this directory.

2.5 Add Links to Libraries
Enter the resources folder and add symbolic links to the required libraries:

  
    
cd resources
ln -s libps2000.so libps2000.so.2
ln -s libps6000a.so libps6000a.so.2
2.6 Set Library Path
Export the library path for later use:

  
    
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/path_to_resources/resources
Step 3: Python Library Setup
3.1 Clone Python Wrapper Repository
Clone the Python wrapper repository from the official Pico Technology GitHub:

  
    
git clone https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-python-wrappers.git
cd ~/picosdk-python-wrappers
3.2 Initialize Python Library and Pico-SDK
Install the Python library and Pico-SDK:

  
    
pip install . --user
Step 4: Connect PicoScope to Raspberry Pi
After completing the setup, connect the PicoScope Oscilloscope 2000 series to the Raspberry Pi. You are now ready to run your Python scripts to obtain readings from the oscilloscope.

Feel free to explore the provided examples and documentation within the picosdk-python-wrappers repository for further customization and integration options.
